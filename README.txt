This project requires the following libraries:

numpy
pandas 
matplotlib
sys
sklearn
zipfile
os
glob
PIL 
datetime
dateutil
scipy




Commond to run the code:    python3 project.py yvr-weather test1

yvr-weather is the folder contains weather csv files
test1 is the folder contains images.

This project requires to use command to take input arguments to run. Please confirm that all input images and weather.csv files are unzipped and in folders called yvr-weather and test1 respectively.
After setting this, take these folder names as input arguments.

Also, a Jupyter notebook file is provided. User could run it step by step to check what has been done in running time.

Be aware: Using all images(about 7000) will make a long executioin time.
please wait for the outputs.
I strongly recommend use 2000-3000 images to test the code.

If it run successfully, it will show how many images have been processed
and give all the test result.
At the end of execution, 2 plots will show up.
Also, images showed up will be stored as png.
