This project requires the following libraries:

numpy
pandas 
matplotlib
sys
sklearn
zipfile
os
glob
PIL 
datetime
dateutil
scipy

Please use commond to take input arugments.
Please make sure that ALL INPUT IMAGES and WEATHER CSV FILES
are UNZIPPED and in folers called, for instance, yvr-weather and test1.
Then take these folder names as input arguments.



Commond to run the code:    python3 project.py yvr-weather test1

yvr-weather is the folder contains weather csv files
test1 is the folder contains images.


Be aware: Using all images(about 7000) will make a long executioin time.
please wait for the outputs.
I strongly recommend use 2000-3000 images to test the code.

If it run successfully, it will show how many images have been processed
and give all the test result.
At the end of execution, 2 plots will show up.
Also, images showed up will be stored as png.
